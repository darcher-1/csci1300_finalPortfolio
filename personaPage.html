                        <h1>The Ratty Toaster</h1>
                        <p> This Project was my first ever crack at HTML and CSS and boy did it humble me. 
                            I had a lot of trouble aligning items and getting the layout how I wanted it. 
                            In this project we were tasked with finding an everday item which had a user interface 
                            and observing individuals interact with it. After we had conducted obersvatons we had 
                            to identify problems with the interface.

                            <p>In order to accuratley depict the interface so that the reader could get an idea
                                of the issues faced, I decided to sketch the toaster on my ipad. This design choice
                                was driven by the wide range of tools available on the ipad which could assist my 
                                near nonexistent artistic ability. In my opinion this was the first building block 
                                in my Low-Fi prototyping toolkit.

                            <p>The audience in the case of this preoject were Brown students eating in the 
                                dining hall. I really began to learn the importance of knowing the consumer/audience
                                in this project. This was another valuable skill to add to my TOOLKIT even before 
                                learning how to develop prototypes.
