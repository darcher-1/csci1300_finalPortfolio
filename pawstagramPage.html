                        <p> Having never done a Lo-Fi or Hi-Fi mockup before this studio was really interesting
                            as I was able to take an idea from a piece of paper onto a screen. The idea behind
                            this project was to create a site where dog owners could create accounts for their
                            dogs and interact with other dog owners. We also experimented with linking the pages 
                            together and getting an idea for how wed pages with multiple pages flow

                            <h3>Research</h3>
                            <p> It was great to have the instagram interface as a base to work off as it allowed us to see how we could
                                add all the elements and create a look alike. I was genuinely suprised with how well this all came together
                                and how accuratley we were able to mimic the instagram interface and then tweak some things to create our idea.
                                It was also also nice working in a group as everyone had great ideas. Overall the research mostly consisted of 
                                finding the instagram icons online and copying them as well as looking at the interface itself and designing it.

                            <h3>Feedback</h3>
                            <p> We had the opportunity to get feedback from other members of the class and they suggested turning the messaging
                                page into a longer mockup to indicate that a user would be able to scroll when looking at the mockup. This was 
                                great feedback and illuistrated the power that Figma has to mimic real webpages. On top of that the feedback allowed
                                us to realize some mistakes we had programmed in when linking the pages.
