                        <h1>Carol's Car Store</h1>
                        <p> This was probably the most intersting piece in the course as I really enjoyed learning how react and 
                            java interact with HTML and CSS. It was also really interesting to learn about react's state property
                            and about passing objects from one part of my website to another.

                            <h3>Layout</h3>
                            <p> When I was designing this site I really wanted to layout it out in a way that let's the user see 
                                their cart and item totals at all times. I felt it was probably best to have a menu at the top which
                                would handle all of my sorting and allow the user to go back to viewing all options in the store. I 
                                also wanted to code the items such that they would pop up in the cart when a user selected them and 
                                I wanted to allow the user to decrease or increase the amount of items in the cart using buttons.

                    </div>
                    <div class="col1">

                            <h3>The Code</h3>
                            <p> The cart was definitley the most complex part of this site as it had to handle all of the math when 
                                someone added an item to the cart and also had to handle displaying and removing items from the cart 
                                when the user did the appropriate action. React made it really easy to keep track of what was in the cart 
                                and accessing that information across all parts of my site was a breeze. This was especially important for 
                                this site where there are multiple buttons that do the same thing.
