                        <h1>Vacation Home Rents</h1>
                        <p> This was a great opportunity to build a larger mockup and work to optimize an existing interface. My team 
                            really enjoyed the idea behind the company and after having a look at their website we decided it was a must.
                            It was great to be able to present our final designs to an industry expert and hear her thoughts so that we 
                            could make the necessary changes to futher optimize our site.

                            <h3>Style Guide</h3>
                            <p> Given that this was a team project conducted over a span of weeks my team decided to create a style guide so 
                                that all of our individually built pages would look consistent. It was really useful to have all the icons 
                                and colors handy and made the design process a lot faster. I will most certainly being doing that in the future.

                            <h3>Design Iterations</h3>
                            <p> What you can see if you head to the link down below is the final product - it however took a lot of iterations.
                                We began with hand drawn Low-Fi mockups and gradually worked our way up to the mockup. We started with four
                                different design options and then used elements from all of them to get to our final product. I can safely say
                                after having completed many iterations of this project that doing it in an iterative style is so useful. Often
                                one can get bogged down in one idea and having someone else take a look and make you think about things differently is
                                so valuable.
